# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is the version control of code. Github is the host (GUI)and Git is the different versions of source code

  Researched answer: Git is a software version control for source code. GitHub is a cloud platform that stores and organizes the code from Git.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Logical operators return a boolean value based on the correct input between variable and value. Comparison return a boolean value based in the equality between value and variable.  

  Researched answer: logical operators tells the logic of variables and values. Comparison operators calculate whether something is equal or not.




3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: index is the numerical place of a data type, index represents numerical place while value is the input/element

  Researched answer: A value is represented by a data type and are typically held in elements and indexes. A index is a place holder for values with a numerical value that starts with the number zero. 


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: like a sequence of functions an example would be 'for loops' and higher order functions.

  Researched answer: Configuring a process that continuously repeats something. This has a starting point and a determined end point that produces a value. 


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming typically consists of 2 or more people with one operating as a driver(person that inputs the code) and the other as the navigator(person that directs and tell the driver what codes to put in)

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a continuonus communication between 2 software developers working on one workstation The driver physically inputs the code and the navigator reviews and gives feedback. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A “higher-order function” is a function within a function that iterates over arrays and objects.

2. Jest: is a built is javascript tool used to test code, using 'yarn'.

3. Objects: are containers for data types and values.

4. Method: A certain action that can be performed on a certain data type. 

5. Classes: Classes is a dynamic structure that has specific syntax for creating objects.
