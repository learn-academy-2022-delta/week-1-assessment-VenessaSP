# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is the version control of code. Github is the host (GUI)and Git is the different versions of source code

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: logical and comparison

  Researched answer: In JavaScript, logical operators are used for boolean logic where a boolean value may be returned depending on the outcome of an expression.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Pair programming typically consists of 2 or more people with one operating as a driver(person that inputs the code) and the other as the navigator(person that dircts and tell the driver what codes to put in)

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an Agile software development technique originating from Extreme programming (XP) in which two developers team together on one computer. The two people work together to design, code and test user stories.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: is a JavaScript test runner, that is, a JavaScript library for creating, running, and structuring tests

3. Objects: are containers for named values called properties.

4. Method: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Is a property containing a function definition.

5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
